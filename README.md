## âš¡ Fun fact

The first ever computer virus was created in 1983 by a high school student named Rich Skrenta. He wrote the virus, known as "Elk Cloner," for Apple II systems as a prank. It spread by infecting floppy disks and displayed a poem about the virus on the computer screen after the 50th boot.
